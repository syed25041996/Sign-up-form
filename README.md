I have created a signup form in which 
index.php -> main page
terms.php -> contains terms and conditions
thankyou.php -> when the user successfully registers it is directed to                  this welcome page

* The user details along with the timestamp is stored in mysql database called signup 

* The interface used to manage the database is myphpadmin

* I shall seperately attach the screenshots 

* Security features haven't been added. I decided to make the code simple. You can add those features if its needed by you.
